PREDICTING TYPE OF TUMOR USING RADIOMICS FEATURES AND SVM CLASSIFER
Doctors around the world need to take care of many patients. Their time is valuable. 
Doctors also can make mistakes due to their daily life problems. 
Their errors are often a result of faulty reasoning rather than a lack of knowledge. 
Radiomics used with machine learning algorithm reduces time of diagnosis significantly and machines are not affected by humanly problems. 
Many machine learning projects has been done to diagnose diseases but these projects do not use radiomic analysis. 
Radiomic is a distinctive imaging algorithm to quantify the state of disease. 
In this project, radiomic features of MRI images that contain oligoastrocytoma tumors and oligodendroglioma tumors are extracted and after removing unusable features 
these features are trained to the computer to predict the condition of another MRI image that contains tumors and those radiomic features are also used to find 
linear relationship between radiomic features.
